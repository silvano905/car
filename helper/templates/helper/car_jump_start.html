    <h4 style="color: #571746">How did this happen?</h4>

    <p>You're late for work and rush out to your car, only to find that it won't start.
        The headlights are dim and the engine simply refuses to turn over.
        You realize that your battery is dead. How did this happen?</p>
</div>

<div class="purple_shadow_two">
<h5>Headlights or dome lights left on​​​.</h5>
<p>Headlights, or even a very dim dome light, will drain a battery dead overnight.</p>
<p>Make sure to check for any interior lights when it's dark outside.</p>
<p>Some headlights are designed to remain on for a while, but a malfunctioning system may leave them on permanently.</p>
</div>


<div class="purple_shadow_two">
<h5>Battery in weak or poor condition.</h5>
<p>A poorly maintained or weak battery may not hold a charge very well.</p>
<p>Even small drains, like the memory function in your car radio, may kill a very weak battery.</p>
</div>



<div class="purple_shadow_two">
<h5>Corroded or loose battery connections.</h5>
<p>​Corroded battery connections can prevent the charging system from topping off your battery when you are driving.</p>
<p>Loose battery connections can also cause problems.</p>
</div>


<div class="purple_shadow_two">
<h5>Extremely hot or cold temperatures.</h5>
<p>​​Hot or cold weather won't kill a battery that's new or in good shape, but a weak or old battery may fail in extreme conditions.</p>
<p>Extremely hot or cold weather can also magnify other underlying issues.</p>
</div>
