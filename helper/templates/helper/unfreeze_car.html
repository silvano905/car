    <p>You’re not the only thing that can freeze in frigid weather. Your car lock does too.
        It only takes a small amount of water to freeze a lock up and prevent it from opening.
        It can happen both when your car has been sitting out in the freezing cold for a little
        too long, or you made the mistake of washing your car when the temperature dips. What to do?</p>

<div class="purple_shadow_two">
<h5>Don’t Use Hot Water</h5>
<p>Common knowledge may tell you to warm your lock up, so many think hot water will do the trick.
    It won’t. While hot water may successfully defrost the lock and allow it to open, it’s
    only a good trick in the short term. Boiling water can actually damage your lock and once the
    water cools, it will freeze your lock over again, furthering your problem.</p>
</div>


<div class="purple_shadow_two">
<h5>Hand sanitizer</h5>
<p>Who knew that little bottle of hand sanitizer could be so useful? The secret ingredient is the
    rubbing alcohol which lowers the freezing point of water and melts the ice inside the lock almost instantly.</p>
</div>



<div class="purple_shadow_two">
<h5>Lighter</h5>
<p>If your key doesn’t have plastic parts, you could also try heating the key with a cigarette lighter or
    lighted matches</p>
